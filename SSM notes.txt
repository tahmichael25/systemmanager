Notes on SSM:
..................
Configuration management:
-Note that things like OPSrum,NewRelic,Apache, ADJOIN and SElinux can be easily done via IAC using Cloud formation.
But installing all packages on many nodes is subject to  mistakes,time consuming hence manual configuration.
-SSM can help automate the above and it is AWS specific. Ansible,Chef and Puppet are 3rd parties that  can be use on the AWS platform.

What is SSM?
-A set of fully managed capabilities that enable automated configurations and ongoing management of systems at scale
e.g patching.

Prerequistes to SSM are?
-Access control or permissions.
Here we are talking about Authentication and Authorization, IAM role (Ec2 Profile role is created and attached to the IAM role)
-SSM Agent.
Here instrucstions are giving to the service via an agent to be able to do installs at scale on targets. Note that this agaent is also installed on the targets.
-Are the instances in a public or private subnet? If they are in the private subnet, then we need to setup a connectivity  between them we need an aws VPC endpoint and
SSM that resides outside of the VPC.
*Note that for resources that are on premise, SSM can still help you do that with the addtition of systems management activiation keys just like giving you
access keys and secret access keys.(Hybrid activiation.)

Story
*
I have use systems manager to automate the confiuration and ongoing management of systems at scale and 
I have liverage some capabilities like the below but also there are prerequisites as above

What are the capabilities?
-Run Command.
tasks here are known as simple administrative tasks that are performed at scale  to systems with the help of run commands without 
human interventions like sshing to nodes e.g netflix and Nasa
-Automation.
It helps to automate tasks beyond the systems e.g. patch or do backups of your EBS, DB or nodes across your AWS envirnoment
like taking snapshots of your AMI in a single account to all other accounts. Run command or Patch manager cannot do this. 
This automation is an enterprise utility or service.(Organizational account)
-Session Manager.
Here without ssh or key pairs you can gain access to the shell.
-Inventory.
This discovers all the configurations you  have in your systems and reports it back to the dashboard.
-State Manager.
It is important for compliance. If you want a desire state for an EC2 to be configure but also you can build an audit and remediation plan
too. If a system is not in compliance, then bring them to it e.g enable SElinux, start and enable apache. etc. note that you don't need Ansible here
but a script to perform the task could be with the help of a cron job.
-Maintenance Windows.
Here there is a date and time  designed to integrate seemlessly especailly during patching.

*Note that Resource group is one Capability within SSM but has been removed and its being managed as seperate service within Aws.
But we can make use of it to patch out systems by groups.
